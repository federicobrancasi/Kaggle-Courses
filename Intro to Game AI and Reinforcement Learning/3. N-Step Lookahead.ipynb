Begin by clicking on the **Save Version** button in the top right corner of the window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n2. Ensure that the **Save and Run All** option is selected, and then click on the **Save** button.\n3. This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **Save Version** button.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen.  Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n4. Click on the **Data** tab near the top of the screen.  Then, click on the file you would like to submit, and click on the **Submit** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n\nYou have now successfully submitted to the competition!\n\nIf you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your code and repeat the process. There's a lot of room to improve, and you will climb up the leaderboard as you work.\n\n\nGo to **\"My Submissions\"** to view your score and episodes being played.\n\n# Keep going\n\nMove on to learn how to **[use deep reinforcement learning](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/deep-reinforcement-learning)** to develop an agent without a heuristic!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
