## Intro to Machine Learning

1. [How Models Work](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/how-models-work)   
The first step if you're new to machine learning.

2. [Basic Data Exploration](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/2.%20Basic%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb)  
Load and understand your data.

3. [Your First Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/3.%20Your%20First%20Machine%20Learning%20Model.ipynb)   
Building your first model. Hurray!

4. [Model Validation](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/4.%20Model%20Validation.ipynb)  
Measure the performance of your model ? so you can test and compare alternatives.

1. [Underfitting and Overfitting](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/5.%20Underfitting%20and%20Overfitting.ipynb)  
Fine-tune your model for better performance.

6. [Random Forests](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/6.%20Random%20Forests.ipynb)  
Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.

7. [Machine Learning Competitions](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning/7.%20Machine%20Learning%20Competitions.ipynb)  
Enter the world of machine learning competitions to keep improving and see your progress.

## Pandas

1. [Creating, Reading and Writing](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/1.%20Creating%2C%20Reading%20and%20Writing.ipynb)   
You can't work with data if you can't read it. Get started here.

2. [Indexing, Selecting & Assigning](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/2.%20Indexing%2C%20Selecting%20%26%20Assigning.ipynb)  
Pro data scientists do this dozens of times a day. You can, too!

3. [Renaming and Combining](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/3.%20Renaming%20and%20Combining.ipynb)  
Data comes in from many sources. Help it all make sense together.

4. [Summary Functions and Maps](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/4.%20Summary%20Functions%20and%20Maps.ipynb)   
Extract insights from your data.

5. [Grouping and Sorting](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/5.%20Grouping%20and%20Sorting.ipynb)  
Scale up your level of insight. The more complex the dataset, the more this matters.

6. [Data Types and Missing Values](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/6.%20Data%20Types%20and%20Missing%20Values.ipynb)  
Deal with the most common progress-blocking problems.
