## Pandas

1. [Creating, Reading and Writing](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/1.%20Creating%2C%20Reading%20and%20Writing.ipynb)   
You can't work with data if you can't read it. Get started here.

2. [Indexing, Selecting & Assigning](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/2.%20Indexing%2C%20Selecting%20%26%20Assigning.ipynb)  
Pro data scientists do this dozens of times a day. You can, too!

3. [Renaming and Combining](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/3.%20Renaming%20and%20Combining.ipynb)  
Data comes in from many sources. Help it all make sense together.

4. [Summary Functions and Maps](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/4.%20Summary%20Functions%20and%20Maps.ipynb)   
Extract insights from your data.

5. [Grouping and Sorting](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/5.%20Grouping%20and%20Sorting.ipynb)  
Scale up your level of insight. The more complex the dataset, the more this matters.

6. [Data Types and Missing Values](https://github.com/federicobrancasi/KaggleCourses/blob/main/Pandas/6.%20Data%20Types%20and%20Missing%20Values.ipynb)
